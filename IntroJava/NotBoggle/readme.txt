These classes implement my final project for the Spring semester of Intro Java at TESC. It is a boggle-like game that is kind of fun to play.

When I wrote and tested this project in Eclipse it worked, but the dictionary.txt file is not being read correctly if I try to run it in VSCode and I am not sure why.
